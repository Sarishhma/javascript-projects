# 🚀 JavaScript Practice Projects

Hi! 👋  
I'm currently learning **JavaScript**, and this repository contains my hands-on practice projects as I explore and build mini web apps to improve my skills.

Each folder in this repo is a small, self-contained project that helped me understand a different part of frontend development — like events, DOM manipulation, forms, and more.
